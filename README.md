## Setup & Installation
**Prerequisites**

Ensure the following are installed;
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) (or install the Jupyter extension on Visual Studio Code).

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/thebugged/brain-tumor-classifier.git
```

2. Change into the project directory: 
```shell
cd brain-tumor-classifier
```

3. Install the required dependencies: 
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
<br/>

## Running the App
1. Run the `ResNet152V2.ipynb` notebook to get the `resnet.h5` file to run the aplication. You can also downlaod the saved model [here](https://mega.nz/folder/46QwiSCY#kTgCWkBJFQ1durISD71zqQ).

2. Make sure the `resnet.h5` and `mainapp.py` are in the same directory then run the  streamlit application using the command: 
```shell
streamlit run mainapp.py
```
The application will be available in your browser at http://localhost:8501.
